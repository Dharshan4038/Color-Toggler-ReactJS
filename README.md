# Color Toggler App

The Color Toggler app is a small application built using ReactJS that allows users to toggle between different colors with a click of a button. It provides a simple and interactive user interface to dynamically change the background color of a component.

When the app loads, it displays a "Empty Value" on the screen. There is a input box that the user can type the color name so that the background color of the component will change based on the color and it will show the hex value of the color and there is a button labeled "Toggle Color" that the user can click to change the color of the text inside the component. 

The app is implemented using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes React's component-based architecture to create reusable components for the color toggler functionality. The state management capabilities of React are leveraged to keep track of the current color and update the UI accordingly.

The Color Toggler app showcases the power of ReactJS in efficiently handling user interactions and rendering dynamic changes to the user interface. It serves as a simple example of how React can be used to create interactive and responsive applications with ease.
